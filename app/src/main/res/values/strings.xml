    <string name="bio">My nickname is Beili. I was born on January, 22 1998, so that makes me 22 today.\n I love read a lot but nowadays, I can\'t find enough time to do so. Also, I have been pre-occupied with the matching-type games I play and of course, netflix. I talk a lot and eat a lot and sleep a lot, so I also have a lot on my plate. I love unicorns and I\'m trying to collect plushies of them but I can\'t commit to them yet. Maybe when I have my own house and a huge bed to keep them in. Here is some more sample text because I can\'t type any more about myself: Hi, my name is Aleks.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
